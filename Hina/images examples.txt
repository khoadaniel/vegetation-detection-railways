file='rs00275' (good veg in roi)
file='rs03635' (not work dilation)


file='rs00039' 2 tracks (can be a good example if vegetation is predicted in th road ballast) it is not labelled
file='rs00136' multiple track lines, can be good to show the ballast
file ='rs00713' only 1 track , traingle region in the center. the file has vegetaion however no labelled on inner right way
file= 'rs00140' detcts only a little beg., okayish example

file = 'rs00600' 2 tracks, gap is filled with dilation , as well as remaining after fill gap , check if veg is detected
note:- hard to detect veg becuase of noise in image like rainbow light

file='rs00230' great exmaple , detects veg in area 


realisation with terrain:

file='rs00321' :- must do with terrian mask multiplied , single triangle surround by terrian veg

# tesing of track model
index 36 -> two rail curves , good prediction

index 202 -> very good example for vegetation do consider
index 184 -> no veg , but prdiction is good to detetc track

index 186 -> multiple_tracks , can be a . good example to show dilation
index 108 -> good eetection of rails
